    Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!

    Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, Last Chance, CO, Why, AZ, and Truth or Consequences, NM.

    I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
  </p> 
  <blockquote>
    Passing cars, <br>
    When you can't see, <br> 
    May get you, A glimpse, <br> 
    Of eternity. <br>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    I definitely won't be passing any cars.

    My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step Segway.</q>
